   VITE_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID={projectId}
   VITE_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET={storageBucket}

   VITE_PUBLIC_CORS_URL=https://cors-redirect-service.onrender.com
   VITE_PUBLIC_DEEZER_API_URL=https://api.spotify.com
   VITE_PUBLIC_AUTH_RESET_PASS_ACTION_URL=http://localhost:5173/login
   ```

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project [here](https://firebase.google.com/).
2. Obtain your Firebase configuration details.
3. Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage services.
4. Deploy the firestore security rules/indexes and storage security rules if you are on a paid plan OR copy and paste them if you are not on a paid plan.
5. Locate the above rules/indexes in the following files
   - firestore security rules - firestore.rules

   - storage security rules - storage.rules
6. Customize password reset custom action URL from your firebase authentication dashboard. Go to Authentication, click on Templates menu, select Password reset tab and click on "Customize action URL" link. Add {domainURL}/verify-reset-password, eg - http://localhost:5173/verify-reset-password
